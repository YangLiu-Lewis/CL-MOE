## Abstract

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered widespread attention from researchers due to their remarkable understanding and generation capabilities in visual language tasks (e.g., visual question answering). However, the rapid pace of knowledge updates in the real world makes offline training of MLLMs costly, and when faced with non-stationary data streams, MLLMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting during learning. In this paper, we propose an MLLMs-based dual momentum Mixture-of-Experts (CL-MoE) framework for continual visual question answering (VQA). We integrate MLLMs with continual learning to utilize the rich commonsense knowledge in LLMs. We introduce a Dual-Router MoE (RMoE) strategy to select the global and local experts using task-level and instance-level routers, to robustly assign weights to the experts most appropriate for the task. Then, we design a dynamic Momentum MoE (MMoE) to update the parameters of experts dynamically based on the relationships between the experts and tasks/instances, so that the model can absorb new knowledge while maintaining existing knowledge. The extensive experimental results indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 VQA tasks, proving the effectiveness of our approach.

## Dataset

Please download the images from the COCO2014 dataset，include [train2014](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2014.zip) and [val2014](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2014.zip).

Please download the instruction from [CL4VQA](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mcAjzmCU1UVW0TKvsHAy9Sr1hmwsJudo?usp=drive_link).

## Instruction Tuning

First, downloading the pretrained projectors in [LLaVA Model_Zoo](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md).

Setting `pretrain_mm_mlp_adapter` to the projector path.
You could modify the `deepspeed config` to change the deepspeed config.

We provide the scripts of our train order in `scripts/CLMoE/Train`.
Note, the `output_dir` of the previous script is the `previous_task_model_path` of the next training process.
Then, you could tune these datasets in your order.

## Evaluation

We have prepared the scripts to evaluate the trained model in `scripts/CLMoE/Eval`.
